# 9. Test the Skill

All of the skill configuration elements *should* be in place. Let's test.

## Link the Skill

Before you can use your skill, you need to account link the skill.

> Alternatively you can do the Account Linking steps below from the Alexa app

1. Browse to [https://alexa.amazon.com](https://alexa.amazon.com).
2. Select *Skills* from the left menu.
3. Click the **Your Skills** button from the top-right.
4. In the search box type *Pager* and your skill will show up. (It should say "Account linking required"). Click on it.
5. Click on the **Enable** button and sign in as necessary and click *Allow* to sign in to Skill Sample.
6. If successful, you should receive a confirmation similar to "Pager has been successfully linked."
7. Close the tab and you should see a message prompt that offers you to detect devices. Go ahead and detect them (alternatively you can click on *Smart Home* on the left navigation menu items, click on the **Devices** button, scroll all the way down and click on the **Discover** button).
8. When complete, a new discovered device called "Pager" will appear in your Smart Home Devices list which supports being turned on and off.

## Send an Utterance to Alexa using the Developer Console

1. Navigate to the ASK developer console at [https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask) and select the *Pager* skill.
2. Open the **Test** tab from the top menu.
3. Type or say the following: `ask pager to beep` (which will trigger the custom model)

If successful, Alexa should respond with "Beeping!" and a tone should play from your computer via the client.
If not successful, Alexa should respond with "There was a problem with the requested skill's response" and your computer will not beep. If your skill does not work correctly, you will need to review your logs and troubleshoot.

## Checkpoint
You should now have an enabled skill and be able to test the skill in the developer console.
