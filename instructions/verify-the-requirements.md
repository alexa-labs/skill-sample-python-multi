# 1. Verify the Requirements

To complete this sample, you will need to verify that you have access to the internet, the required developer accounts, and have the appropriate tools installed on your computer.

## Check for Internet Access
You will be connecting to different cloud services and dynamically pulling down required libraries and other supporting materials. Verify you can access the internet and that you can control your local firewall and network security. 

## Check for the Required Accounts

To work with this sample, you will need both an Amazon Developer account and an Amazon Web Services account.

* An [Amazon Developer](https://developer.amazon.com/) account is required to create and configure Alexa skills.
* An [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) account is required to host the skill logic in an AWS Lambda function.

## Check for the Required Tools

For successful implementation of this sample, you will need a current version of Node.js.
Optional: if you have the [ASK-CLI](https://alexa.design/cli) installed you can speed things up.

### **Node.js**

Node.js 10 or greater is required to run the client on your local machine. At a command line, you can verify which version is installed by running the command:

```
node --version
```

If the reported version is less than 10, visit [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download a current version.


## Checkpoint
- You should be able to access both your AWS and Alexa Developer accounts.
- From a command-line you should be able to execute `node --version` and confirm that Node.js 10+ is installed.
- Optional: (ASK-CLI) From a command-line you can execute `ask --version` and get at least v1.7.20
